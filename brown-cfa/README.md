# T. Brown: Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research
## Examples in lavaan

Examples of the excellent [book](http://people.bu.edu/tabrown/cfabook.html) by Timothy Brown on confirmatory factor analysis translated to [lavaan](http://lavaan.org).

We tried to mimic as close as possible the output presented in the book, hence the frequent use of the `mimic='mplus'` and `mimic='eqs'` parameter.

Not all examples are converted (yet):

- Table 9.2 (Multiple Imputation, code given but warning/error)
- Table 9.12 (IRT)
- Table 10.2-10.5 (monte carlo approach to determine power)

Not all examples use lavaan. Other packages used are:

- [semTools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/semTools/index.html)
- [factanal](http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/stats/html/factanal.html)
