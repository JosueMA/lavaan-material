* If possible a covariance matrix is used as input. This considerably lengthens the code, but makes the examples 'stand-alone' without the need for an external data file
* not all examples are converted
	- Table 9.12 IRT
	- Table 10.2-10.5 (monte carlo approach to determine power)
* links to data files can be found on [link]
